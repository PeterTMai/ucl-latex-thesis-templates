\label{chapterlabel2}

In this report, the structural uncertainty due to the different modelling decisions will be explored. The appropriate metrics will be introduced and the areas that are most likely to introduce uncertainties will be addressed.\par

The following objectives will be investigated:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Current work on uncertainty quantification from various fields:} Many fields that utilize computational models to predict systems behaviour have a framework to assess the uncertainties in the simulations. The different methodologies will be explored and reviewed on their suitability in their use in the framework of cardiovascular modelling.
    \item \textbf{Uncertainty and error quantification in cardiovascular engineering:} A literature review on the different studies of quantification of uncertainty and errors within the cardiovascular modelling community will be done.
    \item \textbf{Introduction of a systematic framework to address the different modelling assumptions made in cardiovascular models:} Through understanding of the different methods and reviews, a framework will be proposed on how to identify structural uncertainty and an example will be shown.
    \item \textbf{Identify the additional steps for the framework to be viable for uncertainty study:} This report will be a proof of concept that the framework would be an useful tool for studying the uncertainties in the cardiovascular models. In order to make the full framework, it is necessary to identify it's shortcomings.
