\chapter{Aims and Objective}
\label{chapterlabel4}

In this report, the structural uncertainty due to the different modelling decisions will be explored. The appropriate metrics will be introduced and the areas that introduce a significant variation will be addressed.\par

The following objectives will be investigated:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Current work on uncertainty quantification from various fields:} Many fields that utilize computational models to predict systems behaviour have a framework to assess the uncertainties in the simulations. In the first objective the different methodologies will be reviewed.
    \item \textbf{Uncertainty and error quantification in cardiovascular engineering:} A literature review on the different studies of quantification of uncertainty and errors will be done and discussed.
    \item \textbf{Introduction of a framework to address the different modelling assumptions made in cardiovascular models:} Through understanding of the different methods and reviews, a framework will be proposed on how to identify structural uncertainty and an example will be shown.
\end{itemize}
