While this project has to explored the different uncertainties that are involved in a CFD modelling of blood flow models, the study has been simplified as a proof of concept of the framework to identify the sources of biggest uncertainties in cardiovascular modelling. In this chapter the further work that will need to be done in order to create proper guidelines to use to the framework.

\section{Additional assumptions to consider}
In this project the image processing, segmentation, mesh size and the blood viscosity has been considered to quantify their effects on the simulation. However, there is a number of the other factors that can give rise to variability in the simulations.

\subsection{Rigid wall vs. Compliant wall}
While most of the CFD studies use the assumption that the walls are rigid wall,
