In this report, the structural uncertainty of complex haemodynamic models will be explored. The areas that are most likely to introduce uncertainties will be addressed.\par

The following objectives will be investigated:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Current work on uncertainty quantification from various fields:} Many fields that utilise computational models to predict systems behaviour have a framework to assess uncertainties in the simulations. The different methodologies will be explored and reviewed on their suitability to be used in the framework of cardiovascular modelling.
    \item \textbf{Uncertainty and error quantification in cardiovascular engineering:} A literature review on the different studies of quantification of uncertainty and errors within the cardiovascular modelling community will be done.
    \item \textbf{Introduction of a conceptual framework to address the different modelling assumptions made in cardiovascular models:} Through understanding of the different methods and reviews, a simulation-based framework will be proposed on how to identify structural uncertainty and an example will be shown.
    \item \textbf{Identify the additional steps for the framework to be viable for uncertainty studies:} This report presents a proof of concept that such a framework can be an useful tool for exploring uncertainties in cardiovascular models.
\end{itemize}
