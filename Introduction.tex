Computational models have been used in many research areas such as geology, physics or engineering to predict outcomes of complex problems. In recent years fields such as biology or medicine have been using computational models as a framework to study processes that are not fully understood or are used to simplify these complex problems. \par

In medical research, computational models have become a powerful tool for medical device design and research of surgical planning and intervention. The computational framework shows to be a very promising tool that could have a tremendous impact  on diagnosis and treatment of the patients suffering of cardiovascular diseases as they provide a non-invasive methodology to analyse patients.
